# Huffman Coding Animation

This is a web application that demonstrates the Huffman coding algorithm. It was created as a final project for the course "Algorithms Analysis" at the [Superior School of Computer Science](https://www.escom.ipn.mx/) of the National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico.

## Visualization

The application is hosted via GitHub Pages and can be accessed [here](#). 

### Huffman tree construction and codes generation

The application allows the user to input a string and visualize the Huffman coding algorithm step by step. The user can also visualize the Huffman tree and the creation of the codes for each character.

> [!NOTE]
> You can write any character or symbol in the input field. Give it a try!

### Message encoding

The application also allows the user to encode a message using the Huffman codes generated from the input string.

In this section you can see the encoded message and the binary representation of the message. Also you can see the compression percentage of the message.

### Message decoding

And finally, the application allows the user to decode a message using the Huffman tree generated from the input string.
